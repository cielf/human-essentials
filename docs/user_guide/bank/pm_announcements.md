# Partner Announcements
This feature gives you the ability to broadcast information to all partners through an announcement that they will see on their dashboard when they log in.

It's a good place to communicate any one-time information, like unusual or new availability of special items, or just anything that should be seen by anyone signing in as a partner.

You can add multiple announcements, with links to additional information, and either have an expiry date or delete them when they are no longer useful. The announcments will be shown in reverse chronological order (TODO:  confirm that there isn't something odd, like the ones with expiries showing first)

## Adding an announcement

To add an announcement for your partners, click "Partner Agencies", then "Partner Announcement" in the left-hand menu, then click on "New Announcement" at the top of the announcement list screen that appears.
Fill in the information in the following fields,  then click "Broadcast Announcement"

### Announcement 
Here you write the main text of your announcement.  It's limited to plain text - no bolds, or italics, or links, and only 500 characters.
### URL for more information
If this is filled in,  the partners will see a "More Info" button, that will be linked to the URL you type in here.   A great use for this is linking to more extensive information on your own website.
### Expiry date
IF you know you only need the announcment up for a short time,  you can enter the expiry date, and the system will automatically hide it after that date
(TODO:  Check -- is it the end of that day or the beginning.)


## Editing an announcement
You can change an announcement by clicking "Edit" beside its entry on your announcement list.  All the fields you entered when adding the announcement (see above) are editable. Click "Broadcast Announcment" to update the announcement for the partners.

## Deleting an announcement
To delete an announcement, just click "Delete" beside it in the announcement list,  then "Ok" in the confirmation popup that appears.
