# Getting started -- Inventory
When we set up your organization, we provide a default set of Items ranging from adult briefs to kids (newborn) 
to tampons. You can modify this list at any time, through the [Inventory Items](inventory_items.md) feature.  

## Setting up your inventory via Audit
Once you have defined your list of items, the best way to set up your inventory is via the Audit process.   
Please see [Audits](inventory_audits.md)

Alternatively, you can initialize your inventory by adding a back-dated donation or purchase, or by making inventory adjustments,  but an Audit is the generally the best way,  because the numbers entered in the audit won't be reported as Donations or Purchases.
