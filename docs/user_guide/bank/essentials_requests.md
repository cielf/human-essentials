# Requests
Requests are how you get the information on what items the partners need.  (You may think of them as orders.)

For a more fulsome description of how the whole shebang works,  see [Partner Management -- Request Distribution Cycle](pm_request_distribution_cycle.md).

## Seeing your unfulfilled requests
We show the unfulfilled requests in two places -- on the [dashboard](essentials_dashboard.md),  and as part of the requests list, which you access by clicking "Requests" in the left hand menu.

On the request list,  the requests are in order by the status (with pending first, then started, then fulfilled), then reverse chronological by date
You can view or cancel any request by usin gthe buttons under "Actions"

## Viewing a request
Clicking the "View" button beside a request on the request list will bring up a detailed view of that request.  This includes the requestor information and comments, as well as a listing of each item requested, 
along with the bank-wide inventory for that item.
From here you can start a distribution for the request by clicking "fulfill", or click "cancel" to cancel the request.

## Cancelling a request
Hopefully you don't need to do this very often, but if need be, you can cancel a request by clicking the "cancel" button beside the request on the list of all requests, or by clicking cancel on the single request view.

## Fulfilling a request
When you click fulfill request on the single request view,  we start up a distribution for that request -- you'll see a notice "requeset started".

Fill in the remaining needed information.  Once you provde a storage location,  you'll see the current inventory levels for each item at that location as well.  Ajust the quantity of items that will be distributed, add/remove items as needed.  For details on the fields, please see [Distributions](essentials_distributions.md).

When you save this form,  the partner will be sent an email letting them know that their request has been fulfilled.
